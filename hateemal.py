Hello ''' + reciever + ''', 

  Your performance in our office has been on a steady decline since October. I am sorry to deliver this news via e-mail, 
and not via putting my fist in your face, that you have been fired. We cannot tolerate your out-landish behavior any 
longer. The final straw was when we watched you march into the office on June 3rd, 2020, with a fish tank full of live 
shrimp. why. do you think we want this. do you really think that we want live fucking shrimp in our humble Tennessee 
office.... how did you even get the shrimp?? whatever. i don't care really. also you brought cornbread in. that is a 
crime against humanity and you know it. this behavior is unforgivable, and also you are weirdly shit at your job??? 
not judging, it was just an accumulative factor in this decision. kindly you can take your shrimp and shove them up 
your arse. have a nice day, and come around at 9 am to collect your things.

best regards, ''' + sender)
